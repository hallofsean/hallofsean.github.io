I may have slightly forgotten to write a post this week and both of my
original ideas for this week require some research that I haven't done yet so I
decided to finish up this post that I first started just under 18 months ago.

*The Black Jewels* is a series that despite thoroughly enjoying I have always
hesitated in recommending. Not only does it need a massive trigger warning
attached, but the setting is kinkier than most erotica (Magic cock rings play
a major part in the story, particularly in the first book). The dark and
corrupted world of *The Black Jewels* may not be any place I would want to be
anywhere near, but they are definitely amazing worlds to explore through the
page.

Like many long running fantasy series *The Black Jewels* was originally a
trilogy which has since expanded with prequels, sequels and spinoffs. As is
often the case the originally trilogy are the best in the series. They are also
the books that deal most heavily with the dark themes of the series. Published
less than a year after the original trilogy concluded was a spinoff/prequel,
*The Invisible Ring*. Nearly 5 years later, *Dreams Made Flesh* would follow up
from the original trilogy with 4 short stories focused on the original cast of
characters. This is continued by a novella featuring the main cast but mostly
standalone from the main plot events of the other books. A new set of
characters are introduced with a 2-book spinoff, *The Shadow Queen* and
*Shalador's Lady*, which explore the aftermath of the 3rd book's climax.
2011 would see a 2nd set of 4 short stories seemingly concluding the stories
of the main cast of characters. That is until a new trilogy of books that have
been published in the 2020s revived the world and continued where that 2nd set
of stories left off.

This post is mostly going to focus on the books that follow the characters
introduced in that original trilogy as when I re-read the series after
discovering the new books a couple of years back I skipped the prequel and
spin-offs. However, I'm mostly going to talk about the world building, both to
avoid spoilers and as that is easily my favourite part of these books.

The elephant in the room when it comes to the world building is the magical
caste system. Nearly every character in the series belongs to "The Blood" a
sort of magical nobility. Blood society is largely matriarchal with individual
castes for each gender. For males this is straightforward linear progression
of Warlord, Prince, Warlord Prince. Warlord Princes are incredibly instinctual
and can be very dangerous if crossed but are incredibly loyal to their Queen.

The female castes have somewhat more variety with Healer, Priestess and Black
Widow all having status roughly equivalent to a Warlord. Female Blood not
belonging to another caste are referred to as witches but that is also a
generic term for any female Blood. At the heart of Blood society are the Queens,
witches who rule over some part of the land, although in rare cases a powerful
Warlord Prince may rule in a Queen's place.

In addition to caste, Blood are differentiated by the colour of their jewels,
the darker a jewel the more powerful. Blood acquire 2 jewels which are both
sources of and reservoirs for their magic. The first jewel is granted as a
young child and referred to as the Birthright Jewel. Once they have reached
maturity, the youth can make the Offering to the Darkness and get a jewel up to
3 levels darker than the Birthright.

Their are complex customs among the Blood known as Protocol which offer rules
for Blood courts to interact without provoking the rage of the prickly Warlord
Princes among of courtly customs. A large part of the plot of the series,
particularly the original trilogy is that these customs have either been lost
or corrupted in the realm of Terreile, one of 3 interconnected worlds. This has
lead to evil prospering with powerful Warlord Princes being kept in line using
magic cock rings which can provide torture remotely and the widespread and
systemic abuse of young blood children. The abuse is accentuated by the fact
that the children are rarely able to reach their full potential when they make
the Offering due to that trauma.

The story focuses on 3 Warlord Princes and the young Queen who is the centre of
each of their destinies as well as one more powerful witch. These characters
are linked heavily to these issues. Daemon Sadi and Lucivar Yaslana (yes those
are their names, there is more to come) are both enslaved with Rings of 
Obedience at the beginning of the Story. Jaenelle Angelline, despite being
destined to be the most powerful existence in the history of the Blood, is a
young girl threatened by the evil plots of others who know nothing of her true
nature. Saetan SaDiablo, High Lord of Hell, has a long history with the sources
of the corruption which I will not reveal here. Last but not least is Surreal
SaDiablo, whore and assassin, who hunts child abusers to avenge her late mother.

These 4 characters, scarred and broken find a family in each other and slowly
heal and overcome their challenges. Whilst some of the themes are intense and
the later books sometimes make little sense I love to experience the vibrant
and complex world with these characters. The characters might not be the most
complex and are very overpowered but are very enjoyable to read. As long as the
dark themes aren't too much for you I definitely recommend giving 
*The Black Jewels* a try.
