title: Plans for 2025
---

This is just a quick update on my plans for 2025 with this blog. First I will
be continuing to post monthly capsule reviews. The December capsule review
should be published immediately after this post goes up. Second, I am going to
try and post weekly in addition to the capsule reviews. This will be a mix of
longer form reviews, esports content, listicles, and whatever else I feel like
writing about. I won't commit to doing this for the whole year but I'm going to
try and keep it up for as long as I can.

The first post should be up later today and will
be based on an draft started a few months ago for an idea I had around the time
I started the blog.
