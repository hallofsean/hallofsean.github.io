I was inspired by [Ken and Robin Consume Media](https://www.kenandrobintalkaboutstuff.com/index.php/tag/ken-and-robin-consume-media/)
an offshoot of my favourite podcast [Ken and Robin Talk About Stuff](https://www.kenandrobintalkaboutstuff.com/)
to write capsule reviews of all the media I consume in a month. In the future I
plan to add to this over the month and post it all at the end but I had the
idea yesterday and today is the 31st so this month may be missing things.

In general, these will be short 2-4 sentence reviews of different media items
I have consumed over the month. For the most part it will be books, TV shows,
movies, comics or RPG products. Other items, like music, blog posts, youtube
channels, etc., will usually only appear if they at least recommended. For
episodic media I will only add them if I watched/read enough to have formed a
proper opinion, unless it is bad and otherwise notable (e.g. *Rings of Power*).

Various other things not covered on this list have taken up a lot of time,
along with ongoing manga/manhwa that I'm not going to cover here every week.
Next month should feature a somewhat longer list including *Arcane* S2.

## Recommended

### 🎵 Poor Man's Poison (Band)
Poor Man's Poison are a folk/country band with an acoustic sound. *Feed the*
*Machine* and *Providence* are good bops.

### 📕 Conan the Cimmerian Barbarian (Robert E. Howard, collected and narrate by Finn J.D. John)
This 35+ hour audiobook collects every *Conan* story published in Howard's
lifetime along with a brief biography, 3 Howard short stories which precede
*Conan*, and a brief introduction to each story covering history and context.
The 2 *Solomon Kane* and 1 *Kull of Atlantis* stories that start the collection
make the beginning a bit of a slog to get through but the actual *Conan*
stories are all at least enjoyable even if often formulaic. Readers should be
aware that it doesn't fully match up to todays social expectations but is less
extreme than some other works of the early 20th century.

## Good

### 📺 🇰🇷 Gyeongseong Creature
[3 episodes] A fairly solid horror mystery show. Not planning to continue
watching at the moment as it doesn't fit what I am after at the moment but may
revisit in the future.

### 🦸 🇰🇷 I Was Immediately Mistaken for a Monster Genius Actor
Kang Woojin discovers a cheat-skill that allows him to act in perfect character
after reading a script. A series of misundertandings occur as the people around
him try to rationalise a complete nobody having better skills than top actors.
Overall a fun 

## Rewatch/read/etc.

### 📺 Once Upon a Time
I've been rewatching the first season of this show about fairy tale characters
transported to the modern world without any memory of who they are. I currently
plan to re-watch the first 3 seasons as I liked them but missed a lot of
episodes. After that point I remember the show declining in quality so I will
probably stop.
