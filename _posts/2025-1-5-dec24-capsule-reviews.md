With 2024 now in the past, it is time for my final set of capsule reviews for
the year. As always see the first of these posts
[October 2024 Capsule Reviews]({% post_url 2024-10-31-oct24-capsule-reviews %})
for more information about the format.

December has been a pretty fruitful month despite a fairly small list. Whilst I
had plenty of free time, particularly in the last week of the month, the 3
video game titles on this list probably took up at least 50 hours between them
and with less commuting I haven't been chewing through audiobooks after
finishing the one I had in progress at the beginning of the month.

The first week of January has already added at least one title for the next set
of capsule reviews and things will be returning to normalcy from the second
week. I picked up several RPG titles over the course of December and one so far
in January so those will also make appearances once I have had a proper chance
to read through them (some are much longer than others)

### üì∫ üáπüáº Born for the Spotlight
The first Taiwanese drama I've watched, this series focuses on an ensemble cast
of Taiwanese actresses as they deal with problems with the brutal movie
industry and their personal lives. Not quite my usual watch but very well done
and I enjoyed it a lot even if it got a bit meta sometimes.

### üéÆ Balatro
I bit the bullet on this poker inspired deckbuilder roguelike at the end of
November and have been playing it pretty consistently over the last few weeks.
The simple mechanics allow the experimentation to shine as you try to tailor
your deck and powers (jokers) to create synergies that will allow you to
consistently get high scoring hands. Probably the best game I've played this
year but falls just short of a pinnacle rating in my opinion.

### üéÆ Teamfight Tactics Set 13: Into the Arcane
While I've played around with TFT a fair bit over the last 3 or 4 sets, set 13
is the first one I've really gotten serious about. While the set released in
November it wasn't until after Arcane finished that it added many of the set
gimmicks to avoid spoilers. The core mechanic of anomalies, while not my
favourite set mechanic is definitely one of the better ones. 6-cost champions
feel like a great addition after the Viktor nerfs. Lastly, the trait augments
and expanded list of hero augments gives some fun, although probably weak
options to choose. I won't call it my favourite set but its definitely a good
one.

### üê≤ A Nocturne (Calum Grace)
Part of a bundle of *Forged in the Dark* titles that I picked up just before
Christmas I bumped this one up my to read list because of the rave reviews it
received. The world this game presents is weird far future sci-fi at its best
and is worth the purchase just in seeing how the mechanics express the setting.
Rulebook layout is solid but like many RPGs has somethings that feel out of
place. Overall, this will probably be the 2nd or 3rd *Forged in the Dark* title
I pt before players as I want to use something more conventional to get used to
the core system but I definitely want to see this in action.

### üìï Babel (R.F Kuang)
*Babel* is a title I'm not entirely sure I wanted to put in good or recommended;
the book had some really interesting concepts and a good story but also some
big issues. Taking place primarily at Oxford during a magical version of the
industrial revolution, the book deals with some pretty heavy and complex themes
around national identities, colonialism and cultural appropriation.
Unfortunately, instead of letting the story express the message the author
decided to extensively footnote the book, something made more infuriating in
the audiobook version which would interrupt dialogue mid-sentence for author
commentary. Some footnotes were useful in providing linguistic or historical
context but others seemed to be there to ensure you didn't have room to draw
your own conclusions from the book and instead told you how you should feel
about the events of the story. It is a shame because it was an otherwise
excellent book that in my opinion didn't need its message explaining at all and
would have been much better without the constant interruption of useless and
often straight up petty footnotes.

### üê≤ Pasi√≥n de las Pasiones
I picked this up in the bundle of holding Cornucopia 2024 bundle. Interestingly
enough, this is the first *Powered by the Apocalypse (PBTA)* title that I've
purchased (excluding a dozen or so *Forged in the Dark* games that I class 
separately or anything purchase in a mega itch.io bundle that I've never looked
at). I'd heard a lot about this game and would actually like to get it to a
table sometime if I had a group interested in playing out a Latin American
telenovella. It does a great job of explaining the genre conventions and how to
fully engage in the melodrama.

### üéÆ Marvel Rivals
The new Marvel themed hero shooter features a fun and enjoyable cast of
characters but is let down by uninspired map design and poor optimisation.
An enjoyable experience to be sure but not one I can honestly recommend in its
current state when I haven't been able to play a full match without crashing
in several sessions.

### üê≤ Rebel Crown
I picked this up in a Forged in the Dark bundle along with *A Nocturne* and
several other titles I am yet to give more than a quick skim of. The concept of
*Rebel Crown*, a group of co-conspirators with different but compatible agendas
who seek to return a claimant to the throne to their rightful position. The
political conflict focus is something I've been looking for for ages and
despite some good ideas the system feels a bit lacking on paper. Part of this
is poor rulebook organisation and unclear mechanic descriptions. I want to love
this and will harvest it for ideas but not sure I want to bring it to a table.
