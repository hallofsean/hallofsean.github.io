title: 5 Great Forgotten Anime
---

To kick off my weekly 2025 posts I'm revisiting an old concept I had when I was
first posting on here: highlighting some of my favourite anime I watched years
ago. Specifically, these are anime I feel went a bit under the radar when they
were new and have since faded into obscurity. An alternative title would be 
"5 anime from the 2010s that I think were pretty good but you might not have
heard of" but that is rather a mouthful.

## Terror in Resonance (Zankyou no Terror)
*Terror in Resonance* is the less loved product of legendary director
Shinichir≈ç Watanabe (*Cowboy Bebop*, *Samurai Champloo*, *Space Dandy()) and
legendary composer Yoko Kanno (*Cowboy Bebop*, *Space Dandy*, 
*Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex*). The story follows 2 genius teenage
terrorists and the investigation into them and their dark past. Clocking in
just short of a standard season in length at 11 episodes, *Terror in Resonance*
is a pretty bleak story which has some fair criticisms but unmatched vibes and
an outstanding soundtrack which has been my study/focus go to for years.

## Kekkai Sensen (Blood Blockade Battlefront)
Generally, I prefer to use translated titles for anime but *Kekkai Sensen* is
the exception due to how much of a mouthful and hard to shorten the English
title is. I will also freely admit I have intense nostalgia for this as it was
the first anime I watched as it was still airing. Rare for anime and unique on
this list, *Kekkai Sensen* is primarily episodic, although it tries and in my
opinion fails to have an overarching plot.

The anime takes place in Hellsalem's Lot, a version of New York City that has
become connected to an alternate reality and has aspects of both the normal and
cosmic horror, although light on the actual horror. The episodes focus on an
organisation of supernatural crime fighters dealing with all kinds of odd
happenings. Both opening and ending songs are some of my all-time favourites
and are regular listens.

## Golden Time
To be perfectly honest I'm not sure if *Golden Time* would make it to my top 5
romance series anymore but when I watched it I loved it. I loved that it
deviated from the high school setting slightly and most of all that it focused
on the relationship instead of stretching out the will they/wont they courting.
That said the plot is fairly messy and the ending was disappointing.

The main two characters, while far from exceptional, resonated really strongly
with me which I believe is probably the biggest reason for my love of them.
Ultimately, *Golden Time* is probably not for everyone but it holds a special
place in my heart.

## Charlotte
*Charlotte* is a series about teenagers who develop super powers. Instead of
the typical superhero story of fighting crime and supervillains, the show for
the first 6 episodes is about keeping those powers a secret and stopping
teenagers who are misusing their own powers for small scale benefits. The
ending of episode 6 marks a dramatic shift leading to one of my favourite
episodes of any show in episode 7. From there the series has a decidedly darker
tone and a unique final episode which I have mixed feelings about to this day.

## Alderamin on the Sky
*Alderamin on the Sky* is one of the most fun shows I've watched. The series is fundamentally focused on military and tactics, similar in many ways to 
*Code Geass*. Unlike *Code Geass*, the protagonist is not a driven strategic
mastermind but a lazy military genius. Basically this is a smaller scope
fantasy version of *Code Geass* that doesn't reach the same heights but also
doesn't have quite as much nonsense.
