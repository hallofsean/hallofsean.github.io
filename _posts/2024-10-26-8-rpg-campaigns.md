title: 8 RPG Campaigns
---

With the couple of month hiatus I took from GMing after burning out on D&D 5e
having now drawn out to about a year I've been looking to get back into the
saddle. A problem I've had which has in no small part contributed to the
extension of this break is struggling to narrow down the campaign ideas and
systems I want to run to a manageable 2-4 which I could pitch to players.

I then had an idea to condense my top ideas into a short sentence and give
those to potential players to get them to help me narrow down the options to
the ones that are likely to get interest. I was left with 8 options that I am
interested in running in the immediate future. I've left off some ideas due to
upcoming new editions of the associated systems, particularly ideas for *13th*
*Age* and *Trail of Cthulhu*. With the exception of one option they are also
all systems/modules that I already own and have at least given a brief perusal.

To accompany this list I had the idea of writing a quick blog post to describe
why I want to play these games. This is different to the long form pitches I
plan to create for the more popular ideas. While those will be focused on what
makes them fun and interesting for players, this is about why I am interested
and why I chose to add them to the list.

## Spy Thriller ft. Count Dracula [*Night's Black Agents*]

*NBA* and its legendary improvisational campaign *The Dracula Dossier* were
already on my to play wishlist a year ago and is pretty much the only idea that
has consistently been one of my top 3 for that entire period. After listening
to a podcast reviewing the system because I was interested in another system
(*Swords of the Serpentine*) that I knew used the same *GUMSHOE* core the
concept of this Jason Bourne vs Dracula campaign complete with an annotated and
extended edition of Bram Stoker's *Dracula* specifically for the campaign was
stuck in the back of my head. Later I listened to a one-shot run by the system
designer Kenneth Hite to promote *The Dracula Dossier* kickstarter and was
immediately hooked by the system.

That led to me seeking out more content around *NBA*, eventually leading to me
listening to the long-running TTRPG podcast co-hosted by Ken Hite with fellow
designer and creator of *GUMSHOE* Robin D. Laws,
*Ken and Robin Talk About Stuff (KARTAS)*. At time of writing I have listened
to over 350 episodes, approximately 7 years worth of back catalogue, which has
only served to increase my enthusiasm of the system as well as giving me plenty
of spycraft related details to add flavour to that campaign.

## Exploring a weird and mysterious high fantasy island [*Lavender Hack*]

I believe I first heard of *Hot Springs Island* from a report of someone
running it in *13th Age*. After researching it a little bit I was intrigued but
felt that *13th Age* was an inappropriate system for running a hexcrawl sandbox
like *HSI*. The old school style of *HSI* appealed to my desire to explore a
diverse set of systems but I failed to click with many of the systems I saw
recommended to run it. Although it claims to be compatible with any fantasy
rule-set, *HSI*'s sensibilities fall firmly into the OSR design philosophy.

OSR (Old School Renaissance) is a gaming movement focused around re-creating
aspects of RPGs of the 70s and 80s and the gameplay that they encouraged. In
practice this means that 90% of the OSR is based of the B/X D&D set, a minor
revision to the original rules primarily focused on cleaning them up. This is
a much more rules-light take on D&D than its modern incarnations and OSR
systems tend to follow suit. In my opinion this makes most OSR systems more
style than substance which doesn't really fit my tastes.

Dissatisfied with what I had found as far as a system to run the campaign, *HSI*
was mentally moved from the "I want to play this right now" pile to the "Maybe
someday" pile. Every so often I would look into it again and in one of these
searches I saw a recommendation for *Lavender Hack*, an OSR system essentially
built to run *HSI* which happened to be available for free. With *Lavender Hack*
I finally found what I was looking for. *Lavender Hack* takes parts of the OSR
philosophy and combines it with techniques from modern narrative games such as
*Fate*, *PBTA* and *Burning Wheel*. The book is also filled with extensive
designer notes which is always something that I love to see. Another important
change from other OSR systems is that it dials down the lethality while keeping
lasting consequences in the form of lingering injuries and ailments.

## Modern Superheroes vs Age of Myth [*Sentinel Comics RPG*]

Sometime late last year, online TTRPG store DriveThruRPG ran a 4-week long sale
having large discounts on books from 1 genre per week. The most fruitful week
for me was focused around superheroes. At the time, I didn't really have a
supers system that I liked and their were 3 systems that were heavily
discounted: Super hero detective game *Mutant City Blues*, the well-regarded
*Icons* and *Sentinel Comics RPG*. The discounts were so good that I bit the
bullet and picked up all 3 (Note that I was already interested in *Mutant City*
*Blues* and it fills a very different niche so it was only really the 2 other
systems that I picked up that competed with each other). Upon digging into the
2 systems I was immediately more taken with *Sentinel Comics*.

Having recently enjoyed a one-shot of *NBA* I looked to see if I could find
anything similar for *Sentinel Comics*. Sure enough the very same podcast that
did the *NBA* one-shot also had a *Sentinel Comics* one-shot, also ran by the
system designer. Once again this was a great listen and sent me off on a streak
of designing characters using the very enjoyable character creation process.
Some of the characters were original, built using the semi-random character
generation, which is definitely what I would suggest if you don't have a strong
concept in mind but I also went with the non-randomised method to stress test
the character creation flexibility. After creating both Reinhardt and Sun
Wukong I was pretty happy with the system.

Despite my love for the system, I've never really been massive into superheroes
so I struggled to actually find a good idea for a campaign. Over the last
several months I have toyed around with an idea of tying supers to a
mythology inspired campaign, finally settling on a concept of threats from the
mythic past returning to menace the modern world.

## 1960s US Government Agents vs Cthulhu Mythos & Drugs [*Fall of Delta Green*]

This idea is the exception on my list in that it is both a game,
*Fall of Delta Green*, and a campaign module, *The Borellus Connection*,
that I don't yet own. I do own the regular *Delta Green* but haven't given it
a thorough read. I'm not yet sold on *Delta Green* as a system, partly due to
my aversion to the D100, but I love the setting of a secret government agency
that fights against the Cthulhu Mythos, a fight they know is hopeless but
which must be fought.

*The Fall of Delta Green* adapts the *Delta Green* universe to the *GUMSHOE*
system that I am already familiar with. Having been designed by Kenneth Hite,
the system is regularly discussed on *KARTAS* due to it's 1960s setting being
a treasure trove of gameable weirdness which is the podcast's home territory.
In fact it was a recent *KARTAS* segment now that the module has been released
that hooked me on *The Borellus Connection* with its globe-trotting focus on
the burgeoning international drug trade. But the thing that hooked me the most
is that while the campaign was outlined by Kenneth Hite, it was written by
Gareth Ryder-Hanarahan, the same duo behind *The Dracula Dossier*.

Gareth is probably the best campaign module design in the business at the
moment. Everything I have read from him has been at least very good. Lists of
the greatest RPG campaign modules of all time regularly feature multiple of
his works including:

- *The Dracula Dossier* [Night's Black Agents]
- *The Zalozniy Quartet* [Night's Black Agents]
- *The Darkening of Mirkwood* [The One Ring 1E]
- *Pirates of Drinax* [Traveller]
- *Eyes of the Stone Thief* [13th Age]
- *Cthulhu City* [Trail of Cthulhu]

All of these are among the best campaigns for their respective systems. Suffice
it to say that Gareth being attached to this project is enough for me to be
confident I will like it.

## Sword & Sorcery in Fantasy Venice [*Swords of the Serpentine*]

*Swords of the Serpentine* was a system getting a lot of hype when I first
started to look into RPGs outside of D&D. At GenCon 2023, it was nominated for
several Ennies, the premier awards for RPGs and RPG related products, winning
gold for "Best Writing" and silver for "Best Setting" and "Best Art, Cover".

Despite interest in the system being what led me to find *Night's Black Agents*
and other *GUMSHOE* games, it wasn't until recently that I actually picked up
the book. It was mostly that without a immediate impetus I was waiting for the
system to go on sale. That finally happened back in September with a weekend
sale through Bundle of Holding, the most effective site at extracting money
from my wallet.

Another aspect that had me hesitant to dive in was a general unfamiliarity with
the Sword & Sorcery sub-genre of fantasy. As a sub-genre that rises and falls
in popularity I just hadn't been exposed to many works and had barely touched
any of the masters. That changed recently when, while looking for an audiobook
to listen to on my daily commute, I happened to stumble on a collection of
Robert E. Howard's *Conan* stories, considered the original works of Sword &
Sorcery. I thoroughly enjoyed this collection (I am considering writing a
separate post on my impressions of Howard's works) which has lead me to
continue with the other members of "The Three Musketeers of Weird Tales",
listening to a collection of the most famous of the trio: H.P. Lovecraft. I may
adjust my schedule should this be the selected choice to prioritise the works
of Michael Moorcock the third of the trio and fellow father of Sword & Sorcery
as well as adding some of the works of Fritz Leiber.

## Running a tavern in a fantasy world [*Tiny Taverns*]

One of the first bundles that I acquired through Bundle of Holding was the
complete collection (at that time) of the systems/settings for *Tiny D6*.
*Tiny D6* is a simple RPG with a number of different adaptations for
effectively every major genre of RPGs. In general I found these a bit too
generic to support long-term play, although I think that their simplicity,
variety and usage of the humble D6 make them great introductory systems.

One book did catch my fancy though, at least for a shorter, feel-good campaign.
*Tiny Taverns* has a slice-of-life charm as players work as the staff of the
second most iconic location of fantasy gaming after the dungeon: the tavern.
*Tiny Taverns* also has more content than most of the other *Tiny D6* games,
featuring an expansion *A La Carte* and small supplement adding a fishing
minigame *The Extremely Necessary Fishing Minigame*. I have been advised to
refrain from comment at this time on whether it was the fishing minigame that
sold me.

I suspect that a campaign using *Tiny Taverns* wouldn't be as long as any of
the other options presented but I think it would be fun for at least a handful
of sessions. I think this to be the least likely to be selected of the 8
options presented but will keep it in my back pocket as a potential pallet
cleanser between future campaigns or arcs of one of the longer, darker options
listed.

## JRPG (Final Fantasy/Secret of Mana/Dragon Quest) [*Fabula Ultima*]

Another RPG getting a lot of hype when I was starting my exploration of what
the hobby had to offer was *Fabula Ultima*. *Fabula Ultima* describes itself as
a TTJRPG (Google translate translates "Fabula Ultima" to "The last story" if
that gives you a hint to the biggest inspiration for the game). Like
*Swords of the Serpentine*, it did very well at the 2023 Ennies, collecting 
gold for "Best Game" and silver for the overall "Best Product".

The best parts of *Fabula Ultima* in my opinion, are the class system and the
collaborative world building. The class system is based off the final fantasy
job system and is built around having multiple simple classes to build your
specific character. For players who want them, there are also example builds
for common JRPG archetypes.

Collaborative worldbuilding systems are a frequently suggested "Session 0"
activity when you don't have a pre-established world to start from. For several
of these ideas, I may employ one of several standalone worldbuilding systems
designed for that purpose. *Fabula Ultima*'s system involves first deciding on
which style your campaign will fall into: High Fantasy, Techno Fantasy or 
Natural Fantasy. High fantasy is the "classic" style setting where techno and
natural fantasy take clear inspiration from *Final Fantasy* and the *Mana*
series respectively. From there you build out the setting, answering questions
and filling out a map template.

## Superhero CSI [*Mutant City Blues*]

*Mutant City Blues* is the 4th *GUMSHOE* game and 2nd supers game to appear on
this list. Of all the *GUMSHOE* games it is the one that called to me the most,
even if it lacks the same level of notoriety of some of its companions. Based
off crime procedural dramas, particularly those with a heavy forensics focus
such as *CSI*, *Mutant City Blues* adds some genre fun with super powered
detectives investigating super powered crime.

The one suggestion that I'm unsure of with *Mutant City Blues* is to set it in
a near future version of a familiar city, rather than a fictional city a la
"Metropolis". I'm not sure that a superhero campaign quite has the same effect
if it is set in Brisbane. Perhaps instead I would employ a worldbuilding game,
such as *I'm sorry did you say street magic*.
