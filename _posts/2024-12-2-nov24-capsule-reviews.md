This is the second of my monthly capsule review posts. You can find more
information about what this is in my
[October 2024 Capsule Reviews]({% post_url 2024-10-31-oct24-capsule-reviews %}).

November was a particularly busy month for me but I've still managed to consume
a short list of media, undoubtedly inflated by League e-sports having wrapped
up for the year at the start of the month. I still have about a 3rd of my
second audiobook for the month left so that will appear in the December capsule.

December does lack any major releases I've been looking forward to but the
extra free time that I'll have over the Christmas break may lead to a longer
than usual list

### 📺 Arcane Season 2
Despite pacing issues making the second season of *Arcane* feel cramped, the
season was still excellent. Unfortunately, it fails to fully match up to the
brilliance of the first season. Whilst the animation and shot composition was
amazing, the second season didn't really contain any of the extremely creative
and memorable sequences that were a big part of what made the first season so
special. I also feel like the soundtrack was in general weaker than the first
season, but I haven't really had a chance to properly marinade in it yet.

### 🎮 Stardew Valley
I'm fairly late to the party on this one but after having tried to get into the
game a couple of times in the past, *Stardew Valley* has finally got me. I
don't think I will play the game super regularly but it will probably be my go
to chill/grind game for when I want something I don't want to think about too
hard.

## Good

### 🌐 2024 League of Legends World Championships Final
Despite a close scoreline, the individual games were largely one sided leading
to a somewhat underwhelming series. The opening ceremony was well executed but
unimaginative, although my opinion is skewed by not really loving any of the
featured songs. Overall a solid finals far from an all-time great.

### 🐲 Pilgrimon
This is a local indie game I picked up a physical copy of at Supanova. It is a
rules-light attempt at a pokemon game. The system is far from revolutionary but
has inspired some interesting ideas about how a summoning-style game could work.
I particularly liked the emphasis on your bond with your monsters as a core
element of such a game. Not sure if I'll run this, but if I decide to try my
hand at converting the ideas for a similar more in-depth game it will
definitely be something I want to run for research and inspiration.

## Okay

### 📕 Tarnsman of Gor
This Sword & Planet classic was entertaining but wholly forgettable. The
premise was far too reminiscent of *Princess of Mars* but weaker in every regard
other than being slightly less racist.

## Rewatch/read/etc.

### 🌐 2020 Seoul Dynasty Overwatch League Playoffs Run
I'm currently most of the way through the Seoul Dynasty miracle run through the
2020 playoffs during the infamous Roadhog meta. I do still have half of the
Loser's final and the Grand Final to go, but re-experiencing one of Overwatch's
most inconsistent rosters of all time firing on all cylinders has re-ignited my
passion for that team. With Gen.G (the parent org of the Dynasty) teasing a
return to Overwatch next year, I have been inspired to write a series of posts
chronicling the history of the team that got me hooked on e-sports and turned
me into a Gen.G fan.
